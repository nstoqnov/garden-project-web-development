Generate a module named Flowers for the garden. 
Create controller named Flowers that will handle individual endpoints. 
The flower must have properties: 
id, name, color. 
Into the controller create four different methods which are:
• getAllFlowersByColor() - Method: GET, Used to fetch the list of all flowers
with the same color. 
• getFlower() - Method: GET, Used to retrieve the details of a particular
flower by passing the flowerID as a parameter.
• addFlower() - Method: POST, Used to create and post a new flower to the 
existing flower list.
• deleteFlower() - Method: DELETE, Used to delete a flower by passing the 
flowerID as a query parameter.

The FlowersController must use a FlowersService that is responsible for storing
